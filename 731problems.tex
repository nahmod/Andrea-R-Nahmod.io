(Hint.  Solve first the homogeneous problem (i.e. $f =0$) using the method of characteristics (as in class or  section 1.1a) ).  Then use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to write $u(x,t)-g(x-bt)$ for $(x,t)$ along a characteristic  ($g(x-bt)$ is the homogeneous solution) as an appropriate integral of $f$.  At the end $u$ will be the sum of the homogeneous solution plus an integral term.)

{\bf Hint for Problem 2} First show that if $y=(y_1, y_2, y_3)$  is a point in the unit sphere $\IS^2$ then $$ \int_{\IS^2} \, y_j \, d\sigma(y) \, =\, 0 \qquad  \quad j=1, 2, 3$$ where as always $d \sigma$ is the area surface element. This can be proved by an explicit calculation using spherical coordinates or also by symmetry, splitting for each $j$, the integral over the sphere $\IS^2$ into the two integrals for the half spheres $y_j \geq 0$ and $y_j \leq 0$ and showing the two integrals cancel out).

\vskip .1in 

{\bf Problem 2*} Same as problem 2 but with initial conditions $u(x,0)=0$ and $u_t(x,0) = x_2$. 
\vskip .2in 
{\bf Hint for Problem 5} Follow the hint in the back of the book and define $u(x_1, x_2, x_3) = \cos(\frac{m}{c} x_3) v (x_1, x_2, t)$. Then prove by a direct calculation $u$ satisfies the $3d$ (linear homogeneous) wave equation. Hence $u$ can be represented in terms of $g$ and $h$ using Kirchhoff's formula. Assume first for simplicity that $g=0$ and write the explicit formula for $u$ in this case. Then set $x_3=0$ and proceed as in the `method of descent' (parametrize the two halves of  $\IS^2$ corresponding by graphs   $y_3= \pm \sqrt{1 -(y_1^2 + y_2^2)}$) to 
obtain a formula for $v$ which should look like: 
$$ v (x_1, x_2, t) = C \, t \, \int_D \, \frac{ \cos\biggl( m t \sqrt{ 1 -(y_1^2 + y_2^2)}\biggr) \, h(x_1 + c t y_1, x_2 + ct y_2) }{  \sqrt{ 1 -(y_1^2 + y_2^2)} } \, dy_1 dy_2 $$ where $D:=\{ (y_1, y_2) : \, y_1^2 + y_2^2 \leq 1\, \}$.

Finally drop the assumption that $g=0$ to get the general formula. 

\vskip .2in 

{\bf Hint for Problem 6a)} The decay in $t$ in $3d$ is due to waves spreading out in space on expanding spheres $\partial B(x, ct)$ as $t \to \infty$. This bound reflects the {\it dispersion} of waves.  Assume first $g=0$ and use Kirchhoff's formula in conjunction with the fact that $h$ is bounded (i.e. \,  $|h(x)| \leq M$ for some $M>0$) and compactly supported ( hence $h(x) =0$ if $|x| \geq R$ for some large $R>0$). From these (plus change of variables) one can prove that 
$$| u(x, t)| \leq \frac{M}{ C t} \text{area}(\partial B(x, ct) \cap B(0, R))$$
where $C>0$ depends on the area of the unit sphere and the speed $c$. Next show that the area of the {\it spherical cap} $\partial B(x, ct) \cap B(0, R)$ can be bounded by some absolute constant times $R^2$- and hence by a quantity that is independent of $x$ and $t$.  Next note that if $h=0$ instead then both terms in $g$ in Kirchhoff's formula can be treated similarly as the previous case (do it!). Finally, for $g, h \in C^{\infty}_0(\IR^3)$ we have the sum of 3 terms all of which we know how to treat. 


\vskip .1in 
{\bf Note related to part 6b)}. In $2d$ there is `one less direction' than in $3d$ for waves to spread out so intuitively we expect the amplitude of the waves to decay slower as time increases.  And indeed, in $2d$ there is decay bound of the form $| u(x, t)| \leq \frac{C}{\sqrt{t}}$ but this is harder to prove.  In $1d$ , however, as we can clearly see from D'Alembert's formula there is no decay at all as $t \to \infty$.
