{\bf Problem 1.}\, \, Given the initial condition below  for the differential equation 
$$ \frac{dy}{dt} \, =\, (y-2)\,(y-3)\,y  $$What does the Existence and Uniqueness theorem say about the corresponding solution?{\bf Explain}. Sketch a graph for $y(t)$ indicating its initial condition on it.

{\bf Problem 2. } Given the differential equation $$ \frac{dy}{dt} \,=\, 3 y \, (y-1)$$ 
{\bf (a)} \, Sketch its phase line and identify equilibrium points as sinks, sources or nodes. 

\newpage

{\bf (b)}  For the equation above and initial conditions  $y(0) = 1/2$ on the one hand and and $y(0) =2$on the other; sketch the graphs of the solutions satisfying these initial conditions. Put both graphs on one pair of axes.

{\bf Problem 3} \, Solve the following initial value problem for the given linear differential equation $$ \frac{dy}{dt} \,=\, - 2t \, y \, + 4 e^{-t^2} \qquad \quad y(0) \,=\, 3$$
