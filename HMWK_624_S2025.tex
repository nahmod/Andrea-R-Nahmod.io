\noindent {\bf From Chapter 4} :  Recall carefully the proof of both  Theorem 2.2 (Riesz-Fisher) on Chaper 2 (p. 70)  and then the one for Theorem 1.2 Chapter 4 (p. 159) 

%\noindent {\bf Additional Problem:}  For any $1 \leq p < \infty$ consider the space
%$$L^p(\Bbb R^d):= \{ f: \Bbb R^d \to \Bbb C, \text{ measurable}, \, : \, \| f\|_{L^p(\Bbb R^d)}:= \left( \int_{\Bbb R^d}  | f(x) |^p \, dm  \right)^{\frac{1}{p}} < \infty \}.$$
%{\underbar{Assume}} that $ \| f\|_{L^p(\Bbb R^d)}$ is a norm ( {\it challenge:} can you guess what would you need to prove the triangle inequality when $p \neq 2$?), whence $d_p(f,g) : =  \| f - g\|_{L^p(\Bbb R^d)}$ defines a metric and $L^p$ is a metric space.  {\bf Prove} that $L^p(\Bbb R^d)$  is {\it complete}.
%
\bigskip

\noindent {\bf From Chapter 4 (pp 193-194)}:  1, $2^{\dagger}$,  3, 4 (show completeness only), 5, 6a),  7,  8a), 10.
\smallskip
$\dagger\,\,$ to show that $f-g$ is {\it orthogonal} to $g$ you need to show that $\langle f-g, g \rangle =0$. 

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf Pb.I.} \, Consider $ f \in L^2([-\pi, \pi])$ and \underbar{assume} that $\sum_{n \in \Bbb Z} a_n e^{inx} \,=\, f(x) $ a.e. $x$. Show that on any subinterval $[a, b] \subset [-\pi, \pi] $, 
$$ \int_a^b f(x)\, dx \, = \, \sum_n   \int_a^b  \, a_n \, e^{i n x} \, dx. $$ In particular if $g(x)= \int_a^x f(y) dy $, the Fourier coefficients and series of $g(x)$  can be obtained from $a_n$, the Fourier  coefficients of $f$.

\medskip

{\bf Pb. II.} For $0 < \alpha < 1$, we say that  a function $f$ is  $C^{\alpha}$-H\"older
continuous with exponent  $\alpha$ if there exists a constant $c=c_{\alpha}>0$ such that $|f(x)- f(y)| \leq c\, | x -y|^{\alpha} $ for all $x, y$. 
For $k \in \Bbb N$, we can also define the space $C^{k, \alpha}$ to be that of functions which are $k$-th times differentiable and whose $k$-th derivative is
$C^{\alpha}$-H\"older continuous (we could relabel $C^{\alpha}$ as $C^{0,\alpha}$). 
Consider now $f$ a $2\pi$-periodic $C^{k, \alpha}$ function. If $a_n$ are the Fourier coefficients of $f$,  show that for some $C>0$ independent of $n$, 
$$ |a_n| \leq \frac{C}{|n|^{k+\alpha} } $$

\medskip

{\bf Pb. I.} \, Consider the subspace $\Cal S$ of $L^2([0,1])$ spanned by the functions: $1 ,\,  x,$ and  $x^3$. 

a) Find an orthonormal basis of $\Cal S$.

b)  Let $P_{\Cal S}$  denote the orthogonal projection on the subspace $\Cal S$, compute $P_{\Cal S} x^2$.


\vskip .1in
{\bf Pb. II.} \,  Let $\phi : \Bbb R \to \Bbb R$ be a periodic function with period $p$; that is $\phi(x + p) = \phi(x), \, \, \forall x \in \Bbb R$. Assume that 
$\phi$ is integrable on any finite interval. 
\smallskip

(a) Prove  that for any $a, b \in \Bbb R$ 
$$  \int_a^b \phi(x) d x  = \int_{a+ p}^{b+p} \phi(x) dx = \int_{a- p}^{b - p} \phi(x) dx $$
\smallskip

(b) Prove  that for any $a \in \Bbb R$ $$  \int_{-p/2}^{p/2} \phi(x+a) d x  = \int_{-p/2}^{p/2} \phi(x) dx = \int_{- p/2 +a }^{p/2+a} \phi(x) dx $$

\smallskip 
In particular we have that $\int_a^{a+p}  \phi(x) \, dx$ does not depend on $a$, as we discussed in class.

Another well known one is the {\it Hilbert Transform} $\Cal H :L^2(\Bbb R) \to L^2(\Bbb R)$ 
defined by $\widehat{\Cal{H}(f)}(\xi) : =  - i  sgn(\xi) \, \widehat{f}(\xi)$. The operator $\Cal{H}$ is bounded and linear on $L^2$.  That is bounded foillows from the fact that $ - i  sgn(\xi) $ is bounded point-wise by 1 and Theorem 1.1 that says the Fourier transform  is unitary on $L^2(\Bbb R^d)$
