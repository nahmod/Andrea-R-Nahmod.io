{\bf Problem 1.}\, \, Consider the logistic population model $$ \frac{dP}{dt} \,=\, 0.4 \, P \, (1 - \frac{P}{230}) $$ where $P(t)$ is the population at time $t$. 
\vskip .2in
(a) For what values of $P$ is the population in {\it equilibrium} ? 
\vskip .1in 

Population is in equilibrium whenever  $\dfrac{dP}{dt} =0$.

This holds  whenever  either $P=0$ or  $P=230$.
\vskip .2in
 
(b) For what values of $P$ is the population in {\it increasing} ?
\vskip .1in
Here we need to find for what values of $P$  $\dfrac{dP}{dt} \ge 0$.

This is when  $ 0 \le P \le 230 $  

\vskip .2in 

(c) For what values of $P$ is the population in {\it decreasing} ?
\vskip .1in 
Here we need to find for what values of $P$  $\dfrac{dP}{dt} \le 0$
\vskip .1in
Since negative population doesn't make sense, we always have $P \ge 0$. 
Hence population is decreasing when $ P \ge  230 $

{\bf Problem 2. }\, \, Solve the following initial value problem
$$ \frac{dy}{dt} \,=\, \frac{1}{2 y +3}, \quad \qquad y(0)= 1 $$

First we note that there are no equilibrium solutions. 

Next we solve using separation of variables. We write 

$$ ( 2 y + 3)  \frac{dy}{dt} = 1  \Longrightarrow   y^2 + 3 y = t +  C $$
To determine C we use the initial condition; set $t=0$ and $y=1$ to get 
$ 4 = C$ hence we have 
$$ y^2 + 3y = t + 4 \Longrightarrow y^2 + 3 y - (t+4) = 0 $$
Solving the quadratic equation we get that 
$ y(t) =  \frac{3}{2} \pm \sqrt{ 25 + 4 t}$ But since we {\bf must have} that $y(0)=1$ the solution we seek is 
$$ y(t) =  \frac{3}{2} + \sqrt{ 25 + 4 t}$$

{\bf Problem 3} \, Given the initial value problem $$ \frac{dy}{dt} =  y^3 , \quad \qquad y(0)= 1 $$

(a) \, Find a formula for the solution

\vskip .1in

First we note that $y=0$ is an equilibrium solution.  For $y \ne 0$ we solve by separation of variables to get 

$$ \frac{1}{y^3} \frac{dy}{dt} = 1 \Longrightarrow  - \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{y^2} = t +C$$
Using the initial condition we can now find C; set  $t=0$ and $y=1$ to get
$ - \frac{1}{2} = C$.  Hence 
$$  -\frac{1}{y^2} = 2 t - 1   \Longrightarrow  y^2 = 1 - 2t   \Longrightarrow y = \pm \sqrt{ 1-2t}$$  But since the solution we seek {\bf must satisfy} $y(0)=1 $; we must have 
$y = \sqrt{ 1- 2 t}$. 

\vskip .2in 

(b) State the domain of definition of the solution 

\vskip .1in 

The solution $y(t)$ found in (a) has domain of definition the set of all $t \le \frac{1}{2}$ 

\vskip .2in

(c) Describe what happens to the solution as it approaches the limits of its domain of definition. 
\vskip .1in

Since the domain of definition are all   $ - \infty < t \le \frac{1}{2} $;  we need to compute :

$$ \lim_{t \to \frac{1}{2}^{-}} \, \, \sqrt{ 1- 2 t} \, = \,  0 $$ and 

$$ \lim_{t \to - \infty } \, \, \sqrt{ 1- 2 t} \, = \,  + \infty  $$
